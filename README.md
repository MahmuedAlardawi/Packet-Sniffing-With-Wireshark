The objectives of this project are I. Collecting and analyzing different types of packets 
that pass through a network. II. Discovering/identifying the layers in the TCP/IP 
protocol suite and their relationship. III. Using a sniffing tool that is used to capture 
the primary data packets (packets source and destination address) and to analyze 
how the packets are transferred across their network layers. These packets can be 
used for analysis on both real-time and offline. To meet these objectives, Wireshark
tool is used to capture the network packets and analyze data received/sent to the 
network.
